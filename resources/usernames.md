# Usernames

***

Usernames are online aliases that can often help correlate information and activity between multiple platforms.

For instance, let's say we're investigating a particular individual and we have the username "_JohnSmith123_". We can use these tools to perform searches and discover their online presence across other platforms, potentially uncovering useful information such as names, email addresses, friends and family etc.
