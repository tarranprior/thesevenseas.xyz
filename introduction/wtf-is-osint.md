OSINT is primarily used in [national security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National\_security), [law enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law\_enforcement), and [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive\_intelligence) functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified\_information), [unclassified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified\_information#Unclassified), or [proprietary intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade\_secret) [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence\_requirement) across the previous intelligence disciplines.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source\_intelligence#cite\_note-row-2022-1)
